Dependency Injection Types:
	1- Construction Injection: accepts their dependency at the constructor level which means that when creating an object of the class, their dependency passes through the constructor of the class.
	2- Setter Injection: known as property injection, dependency passes through public property instead of the constructor.
	3- Interface based Injection: achieved by creating the common interface and other classes are implements this interface to inject the dependency.
Service containers types:
	1- Framework Services(ILoggerFactory)
	2- Application Services: custom services created based on our requirements.
